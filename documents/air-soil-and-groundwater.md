# Air, soil and groundwater

We seek to manage the impact of our operations on air quality, water quality and soil and groundwater resources, while complying with applicable regulations.

### Air quality

There are often synergies to be achieved between greenhouse gas improvement opportunities and reducing emissions of other air pollutants. For example, operational efficiencies that reduce site power generation can also reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

We are developing a range of choices for customers to help people and companies reduce their transport emissions. This includes building our electric vehicle charging business. For heavy-duty road transport, liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a fuel and gas-to-liquids (GTL) fuel and motor oils help reduce sulphur emissions, particulates and nitrogen oxide compared with oil-based products.

### Water quality

We track pollutants in water returned to the environment from the day-to-day running of our facilities (referred to as "discharges to surface water"). We work to minimise these discharges according to local regulatory requirements and our SEAM Standards.

### Spill prevention and response

Our assets are designed to avoid discharges to soil or groundwater. However, spills can occur due to operational failure, accidents, unusual corrosion, or theft and sabotage. Large spills of crude oil, oil products and chemicals can harm the environment. Spills can also result in major clean-up costs, fines and other damages.

We have policies on asset integrity and process safety in place to prevent losses of containment from happening. We design, operate and maintain our facilities with the intention of preventing spills, by identifying potential hazards and implementing controls that can prevent them from occurring. This is integral to our Goal Zero ambition of doing no harm to people and to have no leaks across our operations. Our policies on soil and groundwater are designed to manage the potential health and environmental impacts should spills occur.

Our business units are responsible for organising and executing spill responses in line with the SEAM Standards and relevant legal and regulatory requirements. Our assets have spill response plans, based on worst-case spill scenarios, should an incident occur.

### Product stewardship

Our approach to product stewardship aims to make sure our products are safe throughout the life cycle.

We have standards that require our assets, projects or businesses to identify, assess and manage hazards and risks associated with our products, from development, product handling, storage and transport to final disposal. As part of this process, we implement measures to prevent and mitigate actual or potential health, safety or environmental impacts. Our standards require re-evaluating existing products when entering a new market, altering a product's formulation or manufacturing, or when new health, safety, environmental or regulatory information becomes known. We communicate hazards and requirements to manage the risks of our products to customers, employees, contractors and authorities through product safety data sheets and product hazard labels.

Global chemical safety regulations require animal testing to assess the risks of new products. We aim to replace animal testing with suitable alternatives while continuing to innovate, develop and maintain new and safe products and technologies. Our standards require assets, projects or businesses to apply a hierarchy of controls to replace animal tests with alternatives where possible, to reduce the number of animals used and to refine test methods to make them as humane as possible. When animal testing is required by regulation, our standards require controls to ensure that stringent animal welfare standards are followed.
