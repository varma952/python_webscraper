# Payments to governments

Our operations generate revenue through taxes and royalties for governments around the world. These taxes and royalties are often used by governments to fund essential public services like education, transport and healthcare.

Since 2016 Shell has made mandatory disclosures under the UK’s Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). We have published the revenues that our operations generate through taxes and royalties on a voluntary basis since 2012. We believe that being open about our tax payments helps people to understand how much we pay and why.

In 2024, Shell paid $18.2 billion in taxes to governments. We paid $12.5 billion in corporate income taxes ($0.5 billion of which were withholding taxes) and $5.7 billion in government royalties.

The [2024 Payments to Governments Report (PDF, 2 MB)](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/tax-transparency/payments-to-governments/_jcr_content/root/main/section/simple/text.multi.stream/1747303857887/8c5c10a7f247b676ddef9d408c99823412afe710/2024-report-on-payments-to-government.pdf) details payments in 24 countries where Shell has Upstream operations, including the basis of reporting and a breakdown by country. The report is prepared in accordance with the UK’s Reports on Payments to Governments Regulations 2014 (as amended in December 2015). This is the tenth report issued by Shell under such regulations.

Shell separately, and voluntarily, publishes its [Tax Contribution Report](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/tax-transparency/tax-contribution-report.html), which has a different reporting basis. The report outlines Shell’s approach to tax and taxes paid and covers 99 jurisdictions across all our businesses. For the detailed basis of reporting of each of these publications, please refer to the Shell Payments to Governments Report and the Shell Tax Contribution Report, respectively. (We expect to make the [Tax Contribution Report](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/tax-transparency/tax-contribution-report.html) for 2024 available in Q4 2025).
