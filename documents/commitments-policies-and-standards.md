### Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct

Our commitment to contribute to sustainable development has been part of the [Shell General Business Principles (SGBP) (PDF, 1 MB)](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/commitments-policies-and-standards/_jcr_content/root/main/section_621037715/text.multi.stream/1678867064476/9e830f88e7f5f7b80734ce8ff26659e8926a75e8/shell-general-business-principles-2014-new.pdf) since 1997. These principles are supported by our [Code of Conduct (PDF, 6 MB)](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/commitments-policies-and-standards/_jcr_content/root/main/section_621037715/text.multi.stream/1682939997950/3dd945ef8482f8b9fa4e38ed705e5ae08d6a1434/code-of-conduct-english-2015-v2-new-may-23.pdf), which describe the behaviours expected of our employees with regard to sustainability-related matters including health, safety, security, environment and social performance (HSSE & SP), human rights and equal opportunities.

For more information on this, as well as on Shell's Ethics and Compliance, see [Our values](https://www.shell.com/who-we-are/our-values.html).

### Shell Performance Framework

The Shell Performance Framework (SPF) is the overarching framework adopted by Shell to deliver on its strategy and business objectives. It applies to all Shell companies and provides a consistent approach for how each company in Shell operates. This framework includes our risk management and internal control procedures to support adherence to the SGBP and Code of Conduct.

### Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP

The [Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP (PDF, 175 kB)](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/commitments-policies-and-standards/_jcr_content/root/main/section_621037715/text_663851422.multi.stream/1742569750258/53ba552773426d6a596fc723156d61a4d21cc2fc/group-hsse-sp-commitment-and-policy.pdf) is a set of core principles intended to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, minimise environmental impact, respect our neighbours and contribute to sustainable development.

### Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards

We have implemented the Commitment and Policy on Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) into a set of five standards under the SPF collectively referred to as the Safety, Environment and Asset Management (SEAM) Standards. The SEAM Standards require the businesses, projects and assets we operate to identify and manage impacts, risks and opportunities so their activities can be carried out in a safe, environmentally responsible and consistent way.

We seek to avoid HSSE impacts and risks where we are able to. We follow requirements set out in our SEAM Standards to develop suitable governance structures and mitigation strategies aimed at ensuring that if an HSSE risk materialises, we avoid the worst possible consequences and have ways to remediate any environmental damage.

The requirements align with industry standards where practicable. Where applicable, we follow the most stringent of either our SEAM Standards or local regulations. In some cases, where no local regulation exists, our standards set mandatory requirements based on internationally accepted standards or practices.

The SEAM Standards cover the following areas:

* HSSE & SP and Asset Management Foundations
* Carbon, Environment, Social Performance, Product Stewardship and Quality
* Workplace Health, Safety, and Security
* Process Safety and Asset Management
* Transport Safety

### Shell Supplier Principles

As part of Shell's responsible sourcing approach, we aim to work with suppliers that behave in an economically, environmentally and socially responsible manner. Shell partners with suppliers who adhere to our Shell General Business Principles and Shell Supplier Principles. The [Shell Supplier Principles](https://www.shell.com/business-customers/powering-progress-in-supply-chain/supplier-principles.html) set out our expectations of suppliers with respect to business integrity, HSSE & SP; and labour and human rights. Our standard contract terms require adherence to these or equivalent principles.
