# Biodiversity and ecosystems

We aim to manage the impact of our activities on the environment and to make a positive contribution to biodiversity in our operations.

[Download our Annual Report and Accounts 2024 to read our key sustainability-related information](https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html)

Since 2003, we do not explore for, or develop, oil and gas resources in natural and mixed World Heritage Sites.

When planning a project, our standards require us to assess the potential impact of projects on biodiversity and communities as part of our impact assessment process. We then apply the mitigation hierarchy, a decision-making framework that involves a sequence of four key actions: avoid, minimise, restore and offset.

### Forest habitats

Deforestation occurs when forests are converted to non-forest uses. We apply the definition of forest used by the [UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)](https://www.fao.org/home/en)**.** Our commitment to net-zero deforestation commenced in 2022.

Our aim is to avoid deforestation, in line with the mitigation hierarchy. Where avoidance is not achievable, we require our assets, projects and businesses to develop and implement reforestation plans. These plans include measures designed to achieve net-zero deforestation, while maintaining biodiversity and conservation value. We work with partners and stakeholders to develop robust and credible plans unique to each reforestation project.

### Critical habitats

Critical habitats are specific areas of high biodiversity value in which receptors are particularly sensitive to development.

When undertaking a project in a critical habitat, we aim to go beyond compensating for a residual adverse impact to deliver an overall conservation gain to or net positive impact on biodiversity.

If a project is located in a critical habitat, we develop and implement a biodiversity action plan. This sets out the actions needed to follow the mitigation hierarchy and includes measures to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity.
