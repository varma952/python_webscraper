# Social investment

Social investment is our focused contribution to the communities and countries we work in. Our social investment programmes help tackle important social issues, strengthen relationships with our local communities and build trust in Shell.

Shell aims to be a good neighbour by contributing to the well-being of our local communities around the world. Beyond the energy we provide, the employment opportunities we offer and the tax we pay, Shell supports hundreds of social investment programmes in around 50 countries across Africa, Asia, Australasia, the Americas and Europe.

We have three priority areas: Access to Energy; Skills and Enterprise Development; and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) education. As part of our priority themes, we have three global programmes which are delivered in several countries where we operate.

## Our three global programmes

### Shell LiveWire

Shell LiveWire is our global enterprise development programme for small businesses. The programme operates in 18 countries and helps thousands of small businesses access skills, networks and resources to turn their ideas into successful businesses. These business have the potential to generate long-term sources of income, support local jobs and contribute to local prosperity.

### Shell StartUp Engine

Shell StartUp Engine is an innovation programme for early to mid-stage energy startups looking to grow their business. The programme helps startups prepare their product or services to be commercially viable in the market. We do this through a structured 3–6 month programme that includes masterclasses, coaching and mentoring, and peer-to-peer learning sessions. Being part of a Shell innovation programme can often provide the startups with the credibility needed to build trust with potential customers, partners and investors.
