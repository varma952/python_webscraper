# Climate and energy transition advocacy updates

National and international climate and energy transition policies play an increasingly important role in steering and enabling the energy transition. We engage with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation.

We advocate directly to governments and policymakers, offering relevant information, views, and policy recommendations on new proposals.

We also engage governments and policymakers indirectly, for example through our participation in coalitions and industry associations. We recognise that industry associations may represent many members and sometimes we may have different views on a topic. We join coalitions where there is likely to be a common advocacy objective.

We also aim to help shape the wider debate around the energy transition in other ways, including through speeches and media engagement.

Below we provide some examples of our advocacy. The information can be filtered by geography, topic and keywords. The topics correspond to policy topics in our global **[climate and energy transition policy positions](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/advocacy-and-political-activity/global-climate-and-energy-transition-policy-positions.html)**. We have selected the countries based on their expected contribution to the delivery of Shell’s strategy in 2024 and over the next decade. These include our top 10 countries by expected cash flow from operations.

The content below relating to Brazil, China, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Oman and Qatar was added in November 2024. The international and European Union content, as well as Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA, was updated in February 2025.
