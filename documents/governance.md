# Governance

Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver our strategy, which is to deliver more value with less emissions, with a focus on safety, people, and sustainability.

## Board of Directors

The Board has primary oversight of the delivery of Shell's strategy and monitors performance against our longer-term business targets. This includes the management of sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities.

The Board is supported by four standing committees, which consider sustainability-related matters as appropriate.

## Executive Committee

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has the delegated authority from the Board to manage Shell’s actions in relation to our strategy. The CEO is assisted on sustainability-related matters by members of the Executive Committee (EC) to review and implement Shell’s strategy and monitor progress and performance.

There are three key supporting management committees, with representatives from across Shell, which play a critical role in driving sustainability-related elements of our strategy.

* The Capital Investment Committee (CIC) facilitates portfolio management and capital allocation decisions, and reviews each investment opportunity that is, due to its size or risk profile, subject to approval by the CEO or the Board.
* The Carbon Reporting Committee (CRC) is responsible at the Group level for the Carbon Reporting Control Framework, the calculation methodologies and reporting of GHG emissions metrics, and the review and approval of external GHG-related disclosures to ensure compliance.
* The Sustainability Management Committee (SMC) provides an integrated approach to sustainability by addressing cross-directorate risks and dilemmas, and driving the coordination, simplification and performance improvement of nature and social sustainability topics.
