# Communities

We aim to be a good neighbour wherever we work, by contributing to the well-being of neighbouring communities. We work closely with them to manage the social impacts of our business activities, address any concerns about our operations, and enhance the benefits that we are able to bring.

## **Communities in Nigeria**

In Nigeria, we are committed to social responsibility. It is embedded in the way we carry out our day-to-day business. We work with local organisations around our operations to be aware of their concerns and to ensure that the benefits of Shell's resources feed through to local communities and businesses.

### Scholarships and Education Programmes

Shell’s support for educational development involves assisting host communities to provide sustainable and qualitative education that ultimately reaches all the people.

## Community across the globe

We work closely with communities to understand their concerns and identify how to address them. We aim to avoid or reduce any adverse impacts and to manage those impacts that may be unavoidable.

By engaging openly with communities we are able to identify how and where we can bring sustainable benefits. We do this in many ways: by creating new jobs, encouraging local businesses to be a part of our supply chain, and providing useful skills training for people.

## Access to energy

At Shell, we are able to use our core business skills and technical resources to play an active role in improving communities’ access to energy, particularly in regions where we work – such as sub-Saharan Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.

Our access to energy work aims to provide communities with safe, reliable, affordable energy which can spur economic development and improve healthcare, education and livelihoods. We have undertaken a number of energy access projects around the world totalling millions of dollars in investment. These projects include community lighting, power generation, and small-scale grid infrastructure projects.

## **Nigerian Content Development**

Shell continues to support local content development to increase the participation of Nigerian companies and individuals in our supply chain and operations. This is achieved through a focus on growing Indigenous Asset Ownership and In-Country Manufacturing capacity; Human Capacity Development; Supplier Development; Research & Development; and Infrastructure Development.

We support businesses in-country to form partnerships with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to provide world-class goods and services not just to Shell but other IOCs and independents. We also collaborated with Nigerian Foundries Limited to acquire 3-D printers to enable the printing of spare parts for otherwise obsolete oil and gas equipment hence sustaining production at reduced costs.

The NCDMB/Shell/PETAN Internship programme answers to the need to grow local manpower for the industry. The programme involves a two-year internship for about 100 Graduate Interns (Engineering and Geology) who are assigned to PETAN (Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria) member companies for on-the-job training.

## Community Health

Today, millions of people across the world are unable to access medical treatment. In some communities where we work, access to healthcare may be limited or inadequate.

To help address these challenges, we run various projects that provide access to adequate healthcare to communities, often in partnership with state governments, non-governmental organisations or development bodies.

With the support of NNPC and coventure partners, SNEPCo has been implementing the Vison First intervention programme in Lagos state, providing free eye checks, medications, spectacles and surgeries. Over 6,000 people have benefited from the programme.

SNEPCo also donated an ambulance to Federal Medical Centre, Ebute Metta and medical equipment to the Benjamin Olowojebutu Foundation (BOF) to improve healthcare infrastructure and access to quality care in Nigeria.

SNEPCo, in a six-year partnership with Irede Foundation provided prosthetic limbs for out of school children amputees and facilitated their integration back to school.

## Education

Education remains a cornerstone of our social investment strategy in Nigeria. Our intervention in this sector ranges from scholarship awards to building of educational structures and donation of ICT facilities to institutions.

## **Scholarship Awards**

**National Cradle to Career Scholarship –** SNEPCo started the National Cradle-to-Career scholarship programme in 2014 to enable intelligent pupils from public primary schools across the 36 states of Nigeria and the federal capital territory (FCT) to be enrolled in some of the country’s top secondary schools. A total of 111 students benefitted from the awards in 2024 alone.

**NNPC/SNEPCo National University Scholarship –** We launched this programme in 2016 to support young Nigerian undergraduates in industry relevant courses in Nigerian universities. More than 600 beneficiaries were awarded with the scholarship between 2016 and 2024.

**ICT Centres -** Since 2007, SNEPCo has completed and donated 30 ICT projects to secondary schools and universities around the country.

In 2024 SNEPCo, in collaboration with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), its co-venture partners, and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), completed and handed over a state-of-the-art, multi-billion naira learning centre and digital library to the Niger Delta University, Amassoma, Bayelsa State.
