# Climate

Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. As we implement our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions, we are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers transition to cleaner energy solutions. Find out more about how we are working to achieve this target and our progress so far.

## Our targets and ambition

## Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature this century to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels.

Our net-zero target includes emissions from our operations, as well as from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. The metrics we use to track progress against our energy transition targets and ambition include:

* Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions under our operational control by 2030, on a net basis, compared with 2016. Scope 1 emissions come directly from our operations, and Scope 2 from the energy we buy to run our operations.
* Maintaining methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions intensity by 2030.
* Reducing the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the products we sell by 15-20% by 2030. NCI measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell[A]. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low- and zero-carbon products - such as biofuels and renewable electricity. Reducing the NCI of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change.

We also have an ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 (2021 baseline).[B]

#### We have set short**-**, medium**-** and long-term targets to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016:

### 2-3% by 2021 - achieved

### 3-4% by 2022 - achieved

### 6-8% by 2023 - achieved

### 9-12% by 2024 - achieved

### 9-13% by 2025

### 15-20% by 2030

### 100% by 2050

## Our progress

### 2024 performance:

* Scope 1 and 2 emissions were down by 30% compared with the 2016 reference year[C]. By the end of 2024, we had achieved 60% of the reduction required to halve emissions from our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016.
* Methane emissions intensities well below our 0.2% target, with overall methane emissions intensity at 0.04% for Shell-operated oil and gas assets with marketed gas and 0.001% for Shell-operated oil and gas assets without marketed gas.
* Net carbon intensity (NCI) decreased by 9.0% compared with the 2016 reference year and was within the 2024 target range.
* Routine flaring from upstream operations remained stable at 0.1 million tonnes and, with effect from January 1, 2025, Shell no longer carries out any routine flaring at its upstream operations.
* Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were reduced by 5% in 2024 to a total of 14% compared with 2021[D].

## Our approach

**To decarbonise our operations, we are:**

* making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-carbon intensity projects, decommissioning plants, divesting assets, while sustaining our oil production with increasingly lower carbon intensity;
* progressing the repurposing of our energy and chemicals parks;
* improving the energy efficiency of our operations;
* using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and
* developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for some of our facilities.

If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the carbon mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate.

**To reduce emissions from the products we sell, we are:**

* increasing the proportion of gas and LNG in our hydrocarbon sales;
* increasing sales of low-carbon fuels, such as biofuels;
* growing our power sales, including those of renewable power;
* reducing sales of oil products;
* developing and deploying more CCS; and
* using high-quality carbon credits, such as nature-based solutions, to offset remaining carbon emissions.
