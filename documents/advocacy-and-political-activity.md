# Advocacy and political activity

The global transition to net-zero emissions needs unprecedented collaboration. Shell is working with governments, industry associations, coalitions and others to help shape comprehensive policy, legislation and regulation.

National and international climate and energy transition policies play an increasingly important role in steering and enabling the energy transition. We advocate directly to governments and policy makers, offering relevant information, views, and policy recommendations on new proposals.

We also engage governments and policymakers indirectly, for example through our participation in coalitions and industry associations. We recognise that industry associations may represent many members and sometimes we may have different views on a topic. We join coalitions where there is likely to be a common advocacy objective.
