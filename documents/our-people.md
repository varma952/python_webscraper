# Our people

Our people are essential to our purpose of powering progress together. They are key to delivering our strategy and we believe in helping them to develop their skills.

Shell aims to be an attractive employer to its existing and prospective employees. We offer employees the opportunity to develop their careers within Shell, including rotations across different parts of the business to grow their skills and progress.

People development remains a priority for our organisation. We proactively identify skill and capability gaps for traditional and emerging businesses; offer training to address these gaps; and if needed recruit talent externally to add to the skills and experiences of our workforce. To enable our leaders to lead this change, we support them through targeted interventions including leadership development and coaching. Our mindset and behaviours, which emphasise psychological safety, are at the heart of our leadership programmes.

## Pay and benefits

![](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/people/our-people/_jcr_content/root/main/section_1176419598/standalone_asset.shellimg.jpeg/1741267673883/hero-image-man-woman-in-office.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

Our Fair Pay Principles are designed to manage pay at Shell and help us ensure that employees are valued, respected and recognised for the work they do. Shell's pay is designed to be market competitive and free from bias. The basis for paying fairly is equal pay for equal work, taking into account factors such as performance and experience. Through regular benchmarking, Shell's compensation is typically higher than the minimum wage level observed locally, including in countries without legislation on minimum wage. We continue to engage employees transparently and openly about our pay policies to help build understanding, trust and confidence in our approach.

Shell provides a range of benefits, such as global minimum standards for life, accident and disability cover, as well as maternity and parental leave, except in certain cases where we are precluded from offering this. Our benefits packages are tailored to each country to meet the requirements of local laws and regulations.

## Employee wellbeing

Our goal is to empower our employees to feel their best and perform at their best. We do this by promoting mindsets and behaviours that support good health, by protecting our people from illness by mitigating known risk factors. We use evidence-based tools and provide access to timely support and care for those who are injured, ill or struggling.
