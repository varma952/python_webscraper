# Sustainability through the lifecycle

Our principles, policies and standards regarding sustainability, including climate, extend across the entire lifespan of a project or the facility - from initial design and construction or acquisition to operation over many years and, finally, divestment or decommissioning.

## Acquisitions and divestments

Shell considers new business investment opportunities and divesting from existing opportunities in all relevant contexts including regulations, sustainability and alignment with our strategy. Sustainability considerations, including emissions, are considered during the due diligence process and in negotiations for material acquisitions and divestments. Comprehensive stakeholder engagement plans are developed as appropriate in parallel to the negotiations.

We take care to invest and divest responsibly and screen our transactions against multiple criteria. Before acquiring or divesting a business, we assess the counterparty's financial strength; operating culture; policies governing HSSE & SP; ethics and compliance; and, where relevant, the effectiveness of its social performance programmes.

![Acquisitions and divestments](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/our-approach/sustainability-through-the-lifecycle/_jcr_content/root/main/section_1132434780/standalone_asset.shellimg.jpeg/1741938950438/sls-construction-sustainability-thought-leadership-article-solar.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

Within each divestment proposal, we consider if the potential purchaser has the capability to manage the assets and surrounding environment. When we divest assets or exit areas, we apply well-established processes to guide our risk assessment and the transition of sustainability-related responsibilities and commitments, including those relating to health, safety, security and environment. Where applicable, we also share our emission reduction plans with the purchaser, in relation to compliance with regulations and commitments, for the purchaser's consideration.

## Decommissioning and restoration

Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every asset or operation. We aim to abandon wells and decommission installations in a safe, efficient, cost effective and environmentally responsible manner while meeting regulatory requirements. This includes restoring the surroundings of these installations in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account. We seek to reuse, repurpose and recycle materials in decommissioning. Current and non-current decommissioning liabilities and other provisions are accounted for on our balance sheet.
