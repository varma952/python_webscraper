# Human rights

Human rights are fundamental to Shell's core values of honesty, integrity and respect for people.

[Download our Annual Report and Accounts 2024 to read our key sustainability-related information](https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html)

Respect for human rights is embedded in the [Shell General Business Principles](https://www.shell.com/who-we-are/our-values.html) and our [Code of Conduct](https://www.shell.com/who-we-are/our-values.html).

Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.

Our approach is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

We prioritise four focus areas where respect for human rights is critical to how we operate: at the workplace including labour rights, in supply chains, communities, and security. For each of these areas, we have systems to identify potential impacts and to avoid and mitigate them.

### Shell's salient human rights issues

Salient human rights are those that are most at risk from a company's operations. As a starting point, they look at issues through the lens of risk to people.

With the support of an external advisor, Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), Shell has carried out an exercise of re-assessing and identifying our current most salient issues, as part of the continued effort to ensure our human rights approach is effective and fit for purpose. The resulting list of our salient issues is grouped into four categories, reflecting our human rights focus areas. While this table lists our most salient issues, we are committed to monitoring and addressing human rights issues beyond these areas.

We will continue to assess risks and adapt our approach as required.
