# Our work with industry associations

Industry associations play an important role in developing and implementing industry standards and best practices in areas such as health, safety, security and the protection of the environment. They also provide a valuable platform for industry-wide engagements with governments, regulators and communities on issues including climate change, trade, transport and tax.

### Climate and Energy Transition Lobbying Report 2024

This report provides an update on our direct and indirect climate and energy transition lobbying in 2024. It is the seventh year that we have reported on our industry associations and provided updates about our advocacy related to climate and the energy transition.

## Our principles for participation in industry associations

## Our approach

### Governance

We have an internal management framework for industry associations. This builds on the foundations of the Shell Performance Framework, which is the overarching framework adopted by Shell to deliver on its strategy and business objectives. Our management framework for industry associations also builds on Shell’s General Business Principles, Code of Conduct and Ethics and Compliance Manual.1

### Climate and energy transition policy and advocacy alignment

* Within the industry associations we are a member of, we are committed to advocating policies that we believe are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the world achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
* We publish our climate and energy transition public policy positions on www.shell.com/advocacy. They serve as a global framework for our advocacy on climate and energy transition topics. Shell relationship managers for industry associations are provided with guidance about advocating in line with these positions. We have processes in place to guide staff if we identify misalignment with an industry association.
* Every two years, we publish a review of the policy and advocacy positions of selected industry associations, which includes the methodology for selecting and assessing the associations. Where we identify misalignment with any of our assessment criteria, we set out how we plan to address this and provide an update the following year. Important decisions relating to the review are taken by the senior executive with oversight of Shell’s public policy and advocacy priorities and positions. Where necessary, issues can be escalated in accordance with our usual escalation protocol. This is part of our annual assurance process.
* Where we identify misalignment with any of our assessment criteria, Shell takes one or more of the following steps depending on our assessment of the importance of the topic, the extent of the misalignment and the broader value of our membership:
  + continue to be transparent about our own policy and advocacy positions, and the differences with our selected industry associations, by publishing this information on our website;
  + remain in the association and engage with it in areas where we have different views;
  + pursue our advocacy independently or through other associations or coalitions; and/or
  + reassess our membership, including weighing up the broader business value of remaining in the association and the likelihood of the association changing its position(s), against ending activities such as board and committee participation or ending overall membership.

## **Working with industry associations**

### Climate and energy transition policy and advocacy

We believe that any industry association we are a member of, that is involved in climate and energy transition policy and advocacy, should lobby in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and the world achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

### Transparency

We believe that the industry associations we are a member of should publish the following information on their website:

* an overview of the association’s governance and decision-making related to policy and advocacy;
* a list of member companies, including members of their governing body or bodies; and
* the association’s main public policy positions, consultation submissions and other evidence of advocacy positions (if appropriate).

We encourage industry associations to be transparent about their fee structures for membership.

## Industry associations and similar organisations we are a member of

The list below shows general and multi-sector business associations, sector-specific industry associations and issue-specific organisations that we are a corporate member of, and where we paid a membership fee or dues of $50,000 or above in 2023.

The list includes organisations that operate internationally or at an EU level, as well as those in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Qatar, the UK and the USA. We also considered industry associations and similar organisations in Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Oman, but these did not meet the $50,000 or above threshold. We selected the countries based on their expected contribution to the delivery of Shell’s strategy in 2024 and over the next decade.

See below for the methodology used to compile the list.
