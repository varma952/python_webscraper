# Reduce your carbon footprint with carbon credits

Carbon credits are generated by projects that aim to reduce CO2 emissions, providing hard-to-abate sectors with a mechanism to help compensate for their emissions as they develop the lower-carbon solutions required.

## What are carbon credits?

One carbon credit represents a verified avoidance or removal of the equivalent of one metric tonne of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They can be generated from projects such as reforestation. Proceeds from the sale of credits can help fund the project as it continues to remove or avoid CO2 emissions.

## **How carbon credits support emissions reduction**

### Project investments

Many projects that Shell invests in aim to protect, enhance, and benefit local communities and biodiversity. Where applicable, the carbon credits these projects generate can contribute to compensating for emissions.

### Credit trading

The sale of carbon credits can help fund projects that actively reduce harmful emissions, benefiting the environment as well as the economy.

### Carbon market demand signals

At Shell, we believe in the power of carbon markets and the importance of putting a direct price on carbon emissions. This is a crucial part of a broader policy framework aimed at achieving net-zero emissions.

## Shell's carbon credit portfolio

Our portfolio of carbon credits is drawn from projects around the world that use various project types to remove carbon from the atmosphere or avoid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

We source carbon credits from initiatives that aim to deliver positive impacts for local communities, biodiversity, and habitats. The emissions reductions these projects achieve are verified by independent carbon credit standards.

## The projects we select support the UN Sustainable Development Goals

In addition to reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, many of the projects we select can have co-benefits, such as creating employment opportunities, protecting or enhancing biodiversity, improving soil quality, food production, or enhancing climate change resistance. Many of these co-benefits support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do carbon credits work?

Each tonne of CO2 stored or avoided by a carbon compensation project generates one carbon credit. To ensure that the projects we work with are making a real and verifiable impact, we only select projects certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards.

### How are carbon credits created?

The emissions avoided or reduced are quantified and verified by an independent third party enabling one carbon credit to be generated for every one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent avoided or removed from the atmosphere. Proceeds from the sale of credits can in some instances help fund the project as it continues to remove or avoid CO2 emissions.

### Does Shell compensate for its emissions?

Shell uses carbon credits primarily to manage our Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) and to offset emissions across different scopes. Shell's NCI includes carbon credits to offset emissions from the end-use of energy products we sell **[our climate target](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/climate.html)**

### What are common certification standards for carbon credits?

We source carbon credits verified against using different types of projects developed by internationally recognised accreditation bodies such as Verra, Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, and Puerto.earth. Each credit undergoes a review by our internal experts to ensure that the projects adhere to our due diligence standards.

### Helping compensate emissions with carbon credits

Carbon credits are not the only solution needed: effective, long-term decarbonisation requires avoiding and reducing emissions. But compensating emissions with carbon credits can play a valuable additional role.

![](https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/environmental-products/carbon-credits/_jcr_content/root/main/section_1460415826/promo_copy.shellimg.jpeg/1743588869028/how-carbon-compensation-works.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

### How carbon compensation works

Carbon compensation works by buying credits to compensate for emissions that cannot yet be avoided or reduced.
