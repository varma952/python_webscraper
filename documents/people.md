# People

Shell strives to make a positive impact on people around the world, and this includes providing the energy people need, contributing to local economies and communities, championing inclusion and respecting human rights.

[Download our Annual Report and Accounts 2024 to read our key sustainability-related information](https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/annual-report.html)

We help ensure energy security in our key markets and invest in businesses that supply energy access in emerging markets. Through our [social investments](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/people/social-investment.html), we also provide funds, expertise and resources to increase energy access outside of our commercial business. The supply of affordable and secure energy is crucial for addressing global challenges, including those related to poverty and inequality.

Our activities contribute to economies and communities around the world through job creation, spending on goods and services, and through the payment of taxes and royalties to governments. Across more than 70 countries, we employ thousands of people and provide them with opportunities to develop their careers.

As we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business, we work with governments and society to support positive economic and social impacts of the transition on our workforce, communities, suppliers and customers.

Our [core values](https://www.shell.com/who-we-are/our-values.html) of honesty, integrity and respect for people underpin everything we do.

We aim to become [one of the world's most diverse and inclusive organisations](https://www.shell.com/who-we-are/diversity-equity-and-inclusion.html), a place where everyone feels valued, respected and has a strong sense of belonging.

The importance of respecting people also extends to our suppliers. [Shell's Supplier Principles](https://www.shell.com/business-customers/powering-progress-in-supply-chain/supplier-principles.html) outline our expectations for business integrity, health safety, security, labour and human rights, and environmental and social performance.

Many of our operations are located close to communities and we aim to be a good neighbour. This includes strong community engagement, managing the negative social impacts of our operations and delivering a range of benefits through jobs, local business opportunities and social investment programmes. This engagement enables us to identify and manage impacts from our activities and provide access to remedy.
