# Our approach to sustainability

Our commitment to contribute to sustainable development has been part of the Shell General Business Principles since 1997. We have embedded this sustainability commitment into our strategy, business processes and decision-making, supported by comprehensive governance structures, policies and standards.

## Working with others

Shell understands the need to work with others to achieve our commercial, environmental and social goals. We engage with local communities and other stakeholders in all our activities. We listen to their ideas and the concerns they might have so these can be addressed in the design and operation of our assets.

Shell participates in external collaborations, industry associations and partnerships. We do this in compliance with antitrust rules and regulations.

These engagements are a proven way to learn and share best practices, achieve specific objectives and build trust with the many different stakeholders who have an interest in Shell.
