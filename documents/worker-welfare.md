# Worker welfare

We respect worker rights and promote welfare, enabling better performance through care, reflecting our core values and commitment to safety. When people feel cared for, they perform at their best.

Our [approach to worker welfare (PDF, 645 kB)](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/people/worker-welfare/_jcr_content/root/main/section_832979073/text.multi.stream/1743688781743/17d226ba1dedb52a09b30f819f03cc617d1270ba/shells-approach-to-human-rights.pdf) is based on the [Building Responsibly principles](https://www.building-responsibly.org/worker-welfare-principles), developed by an alliance of companies that seeks to promote the rights and welfare of workers in the engineering and construction industry. Our approach to worker welfare focuses on the well-being of supplier staff on Shell sites and dedicated supplier staff on non-Shell sites, where we have the most ability to influence safety, working conditions and labour rights.

By integrating the Building Responsibly principles into our Safety, Environment & Asset Management (SEAM) standard on Workplace Health, Safety, and Security, we seek to ensure these standards are applied across our operations using a risk-based approach. For example, we expect our suppliers to provide fair and accessible resolution and remediation, safe and healthy working conditions with clear policies on working hours and minimum wage, and decent living conditions for workers.

Together with our industry peers and suppliers, we strive to raise the bar for Worker Welfare. Working through associations like [IOGP](https://www.iogp.org/ "https://www.iogp.org/"), [IPIECA](https://www.ipieca.org/ "https://www.ipieca.org/") and [Building Responsibly](https://www.building-responsibly.org/worker-welfare-principles "https://www.building-responsibly.org/worker-welfare-principles"), as well as contractor forums, helps raise expectations and levels of consistency across the industry, impacting over a million workers.

## Implementing the Building Responsibly principles on LNG Canada project

![Oil and gas production at Obaiyed Field, Egypt 2012](https://www.shell.com/sustainability/people/worker-welfare/_jcr_content/root/main/section/standalone_asset.shellimg.jpeg/1726046225680/oil-and-gas-production-at-obaiyed-field-egypt-2012.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

The LNG Canada project, a joint venture between Shell, PETRONAS, PetroChina, Mitsubishi Corporation and KOGAS that is building a Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) plant in Canada, implemented the Building Responsibly Worker Welfare Principles at their Fabrication Yard in China and found they made a significant difference in overall project performance. It serves as an example for contractors to replicate in future building and construction projects.

Six leadership task teams were formed to address the most critical challenges and opportunities for positive impact at the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (COOEC) fabrication yard. One of the Building Responsibly partnerships, composed of the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contractor JGC Fluor, LNG Canada and COOEC looked at how best to implement the Building Responsibly Worker Welfare Principles, to help workers thrive and improve overall project performance.

**Setting themselves up for success**: The team responsible for the implementation of the project consisted of representatives from the client, contractor, subcontractor, and supervision side. From the beginning of the project, they engaged with members of the workforce to learn about, and address challenges and opportunities related to worker’s health and safety. This helped the team build their evidence base, ensure the effectiveness of the program, and build a trusting relationship with the workforce.

**Making changes**: New break rooms and toilet facilities were built, as well as a new canteen. In addition, the Project Performance Maintenance program (originally called the ‘Perfect Day Program’) was developed to enhance team performance. The program established a monthly competition between teams that awarded prizes for the best results in health and safety, quality, final project delivery and overall fabrication. Treating workers with respect and dignity by improving their health and welfare, and recognizing their contribution to improve outcomes, is not only the right thing to do, but also leads to positive impacts in their performance and the performance of the overall business.

**Assessing the impact**: The project led to 30 million safe work hours being logged, with one injury recorded throughout the whole project timeline. The injured worker was provided with full medical support and returned to work.

The sentiment of the workforce related to the project was overall positive and many voiced their appreciation for being treated so well at work. A lot of the workers are working thousands of kilometres away from their homes and families but stated that they are happy to be working on the LNG Canada project.
