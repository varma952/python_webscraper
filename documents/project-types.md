# Project types within our portfolio

The diverse range of carbon credit projects in our portfolio aim to deliver measurable climate benefits. Each approach supports credible emissions reductions in line with recognised standards.

## **How we reduce and remove emissions**

Our carbon credits are sourced from diverse project types, including conservation, cleaner technologies, reforestation, and waste management, which focus on removing, avoiding, or reducing emissions.

Each project type aligns with independent carbon credit standards and can also support communities and biodiversity.

## Project types for emissions reduction

![Conservation](https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/environmental-products/project-types/_jcr_content/root/main/section_2113349962/promo_copy_copy_copy.shellimg.jpeg/1743590825919/carbon-credit-requirements.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

### Conservation

Conservation initiatives protect and restore ecosystems, preventing emissions that would result from their degradation or destruction. By maintaining natural carbon sinks such as forests, wetlands, and grasslands, these projects help preserve biodiversity while reducing atmospheric carbon.

![Household Devices](https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/environmental-products/project-types/_jcr_content/root/main/section_2113349962/promo.shellimg.jpeg/1743590844874/houji-solar-cooker-project.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

### Household Devices

Household devices avoid carbon emissions by providing less carbon intensive ways to fulfil household needs. High performance cookstoves, for example, give families an alternative to open fires which avoid greenhouse gas emissions, household air pollutants, and the need to cut down trees for fuel.

![Waste Management](https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/environmental-products/project-types/_jcr_content/root/main/section_2113349962/promo_copy_1467067317.shellimg.jpeg/1743590862506/methane-recovery-and-biogas-utilisation-project-quang-tri-province-vietnam.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

### Waste Management

Waste management projects prevent harmful emissions by capturing landfill gas (LFG), a major source of methane pollution. By converting LFG into energy, these initiatives reduce environmental impact while promoting sustainable waste solutions.

![Reforestation and Afforestation](https://www.shell.com/shellenergy/othersolutions/environmental-products/project-types/_jcr_content/root/main/section_2113349962/promo_copy.shellimg.jpeg/1743590880392/qinghai-afforestation.jpeg?imwidth=48&impolicy=amidala-thumb)

### Reforestation and Afforestation

Forestry projects capture carbon by planting trees in areas where forests have been lost (reforestation) or where they haven’t existed for decades (afforestation). As trees grow, they absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere, storing it as part of a long-term climate solution.

## Shell's internal screening process evaluates projects based on:

### The approved carbon environmental impact standard

### Environmental impact standard beyond CO₂

### Benefits for the local community

### Project developer competency

### Government support

### Reputational risks

## The projects we select support the UN Sustainable Development Goals

In addition to reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, many of the projects we select can have co-benefits, such as creating employment opportunities, protecting or enhancing biodiversity, improving soil quality, food production, or enhancing climate change resistance. Many of these co-benefits support the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
