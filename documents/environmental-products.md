# Environmental products, tomorrow is today’s job

Carbon credits offer a key, additional contribution to help businesses achieve net-zero emissions. Shell is clear that carbon credits need to deliver a robust carbon benefit and positively impact ecosystems and communities. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards, including Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to help assess that the carbon credits we offer and use are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered.

## Helping you navigate carbon markets on your decarbonisation journey.

### Diverse portfolio

Shell's diverse portfolio of environmental products caters to a wide spectrum of business needs, offering solutions that align with various environmental and corporate objectives.

### Due diligence

Each carbon credit in Shell’s portfolio undergoes due diligence to ensure rigorous evaluation and quality assurance.

### Experience

Leveraging years of experience, Shell helps businesses effectively navigate the complexities of carbon markets, supporting them to make informed, impactful decisions.

### Compensate emissions with carbon credits

Shell takes a three step approach to decarbonisation:

* **Avoid** creating emissions
* **Reduce** emissions
* **Compensate** for remaining emissions through the use of carbon credits as not all industries can decarbonise at the same rate, with heavy industry and transport often utilising carbon credits to achieve net-zero goals. We actively participate in carbon markets, and have a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint.

## Shell's carbon credit portfolio

Our portfolio of carbon credits is drawn from projects around the world that use various project types to remove carbon from the atmosphere or avoid and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

We source carbon credits from initiatives that aim to deliver positive impacts for local communities, biodiversity, and habitats. The emissions reductions these projects achieve are verified by independent carbon credit standards.
