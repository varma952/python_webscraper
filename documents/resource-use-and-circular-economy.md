# Resource use and circular economy

We aim to use water and other resources efficiently, and to increase our reuse and recycling.

### Waste and circularity

Our businesses are deepening their efforts to better understand the types of waste we generate and identify options to increase circular approaches.

In 2024, we introduced a new requirement within our SEAM Standards for our assets, projects or businesses to develop strategies to identify circularity-related risks and opportunities. Through this, we aim to encourage the development of fit-for-purpose objectives and strategies based on the principles of rethink, refuse, reduce, reuse, recycle and repair.

Since 2021, we have completed detailed assessments across our businesses to better understand the types of waste we generate and identify options to increase circular approaches. Using these results, our assets are improving local waste management practices by prioritising waste prevention, reuse and recycling over energy recovery and disposal.

### Plastics

Shell supports the need for improved circularity of the global plastics market. We encourage reduction, reuse and recycling of plastics and are a founding member of the [Alliance to End Plastic Waste](https://www.endplasticwaste.org/), which helps governments to assess and improve waste collection and waste management. We are working with partners across the plastic waste value chain, such as the waste management industry and pyrolysis oil producers, to encourage the development of a more circular value chain.

Since 2019, Shell has been processing pyrolysis oil made from mixed plastic waste at the Shell Norco Energy and Chemicals Park in the USA. In 2024, we began production at our new pyrolysis oil upgrader at the Shell Chemicals Park Moerdijk in the Netherlands. The upgrader improves the quality of pyrolysis oil, a liquid made from hard-to-recycle plastic waste, and turns it into chemical feedstock. The plant has the capacity to process up to 50,000 tonnes of pyrolysis oil per year.

### Packaging

We have a priority to increase the amount of recycled plastic in Shell-branded packaging to 30% by 2030, based on the reference year of 2022, and to use packaging for our products that is reusable or recyclable by design. These priorities apply to Shell-branded Mobility and Lubricants products.

### Renewable and waste based bio feedstocks

Shell aims to be a significant and profitable supplier of low-carbon fuels to help decarbonise harder-to-abate sectors including aviation, marine and commercial road transport.

Our approach to sourcing renewable components and feedstock is governed by our Policy on Sustainable Sourcing of Biocomponents.
