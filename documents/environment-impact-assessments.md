# Environmental Impact Assessment Reports

In Nigeria, we complete Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessments (EIAs) for all our development projects, in accordance with Nigerian Law. The aim is to reduce the environmental and social impact of our activities as much as possible and look for benefits for affected communities.

Our EIA reports stipulate how we manage the impact and benefit to the environment and society. It is an instrument by which we identify and assess the potential environmental, social and health impacts of a proposed project, evaluate alternatives, and design appropriate environmental and social management plans during the life-cycle of the project. These reports are scrutinised by the regulator as part of the approval process for the project.

EIAs are required for:

1. Oil and gas fields development;
2. Construction of off-shore, on-shore and overland pipelines;
3. Construction of oil and gas separation, processing, handling and storage facilities;
4. Construction of oil refineries;
5. Construction of product depots for the storage of petrol, gas or diesel which are located within three kilometres of any commercial, industrial or residential areas and which have a combined storage capacity of 60,000 barrels or more;
6. Petroleum refining.
