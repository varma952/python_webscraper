# Corporate political engagement transparency statement and lobbying spend

We advocate our positions on matters which affect us, our employees, customers, shareholders or local communities, in accordance with our values and the Shell General Business Principles.

Our statement on corporate political engagement, provided below, is based on Transparency International – UK’s principles for corporate political engagement transparency. It provides details of our approach in four main areas:

* internal governance
* political payments
* responsible lobbying
* recruitment and secondments.

### Regulated lobbying disclosures, including lobbying expenditure

In the European Union (EU), Germany and the USA, we report expenditure associated with our lobbying activities in line with the requirements and guidelines set out in the EU Transparency Register, German Lobbying Transparency Regulation and the US Lobbying Disclosure Act respectively. There are different rules for which costs should be reported in these three submissions and we are required to comply with the appropriate requirements for each jurisdiction. These submissions are publicly available:

* In the EU, Shell’s submission to the EU Transparency Register can be accessed at transparency-register.europa.eu by searching the REG Number: “05032108616-26”. Shell’s reported “Estimated annual costs attributable to activities covered by the register” were €4,500,000 to €4,999,999 in 2024.
* In Germany, Shell’s submissions to the Lobby Register can be accessed at www.lobbyregister.bundestag.de/startseite by searching the registration numbers: “R001354” (Deutsche Shell Holding GmbH) and “R001348” (Shell Deutschland GmbH). In 2023, Shell’s reported “Annual financial expenditure in the area of representation of interests” was € 210,001-220,000 and € 1,120,001-1,130,000 respectively. We expect the data for 2024 to be published in the German Lobby Register by June 30, 2025.
* In the USA, Shell’s submissions under the Lobbying Disclosure Act can be accessed at disclosurespreview.house.gov by searching House ID: “316890000”. Shell’s reported expenses related to lobbying practices were $7,060,000 in 2024.

We also provided submissions in some other countries, though these are not required to include lobbying spend.

* In Canada, Shell’s submission to the Registry of Lobbyists can be accessed at https://lobbycanada.gc.ca/en/ by searching the keywords: “Shell Canada Limited”.
* In Scotland, Shell’s submission to the Lobbying Register can be accessed at lobbying.scot/SPS/Search/Search by searching the registrant: “Shell U.K. Limited”.
