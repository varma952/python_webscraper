In anticipation of the transposition by the Netherlands of the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) into national law, a key development for Shell in 2024 has been the voluntary implementation of the CSRD and the accompanying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The CSRD requires certain European and non-European companies (including Shell plc due to its listing on Euronext Amsterdam) to make disclosures on environmental, social and governance topics in accordance with reporting standards set out in the ESRS. With the introduction of the Sustainability Statements (pages 341-440) in our Annual Report and Accounts 2024 (published March 25, 2025), we have retired our voluntary Sustainability Report after 27 years.
