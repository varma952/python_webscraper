# Water

We are implementing water stewardship principles across our businesses and developing water stewardship management plans. This includes focusing on the sustainable management of fresh water resources, particularly in water-stressed areas.

## Our approach

We require our assets, projects or businesses to manage sourcing, use, treatment and disposal of water based on recognised water stewardship principles and to implement this through a water stewardship management plan. These plans help us to move away â€¨from a traditional inside-out approach focusing on our impact on the environment to an outside-in approach that considers how we impact, and are impacted by, the environment. They also help us to reduce consumption in water-stressed areas.

We have conducted water stewardship assessments at assets across different businesses and regions, with a priority on operations in areas of high water stress and those that use significant quantities of fresh water. The insights gained from these assessments have moved us towards a more holistic stewardship approach. This goes beyond only focusing on water use to also considering factors such as water footprint, regional water stress, water quality, catchments, governance and stakeholder engagement.

In 2021, we set a voluntary commitment to reduce our consumption of fresh water by 15% by 2025 compared with 2018 levels in areas where there is high fresh-water stress. We achieved this commitment ahead of time in 2022.
