### Shell Energy Transition Strategy 2024

Our energy transition update shows how we are delivering against our climate targets. As we focus on areas of competitive strength, we are investing $10-15 billion on low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025. We are also investing in oil and gas production with lower emissions as we provide energy today while helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future.
