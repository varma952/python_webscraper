# Why choose Shell for your decarbonisation journey?

Working with Shell means gaining access to carbon credits provided with integrity. We invest globally and offer a diverse portfolio of environmental products. While carbon credits go some way towards a solution, we understand that long-term decarbonisation starts with avoiding and reducing emissions wherever possible.

### Environmental products

We believe that carbon credits are an important additional tool for society to help meet its climate ambitions. Shell's Environmental Products business has a strategy that is rooted in trust and integrity. Projects in our portfolio are subject to a selection process, with substantial time, effort and resources invested into undertaking due diligence.

### Our mission

Our aim is to go one step further in assessing the strength, value, and trustworthiness of our investments. This is not just a priority for Shell, but is a prerequisite to the success of carbon markets as a whole.

## Our milestones

### EU ETS

Shell led the first EU ETS trade in 2003

### Nature-based solutions

We invest directly in natural ecosystems to increase the supply of carbon credits and help meet growing demand from customers.

### Credit trading

In addition to supplementing companies’ decarbonisation efforts, these projects can deliver important co-benefits ranging from biodiversity protection to public-health improvements and job creation, in many cases aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
